# Helm Journey

## What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deploying and managing applications. It uses "charts"—pre-configured application templates—for easy installation, upgrades, and management of Kubernetes apps.

## Why Use Helm?

Helm simplifies Kubernetes app management by:
- Providing reusable and customizable application templates (charts).
- Easing app lifecycle management (install, upgrade, rollback, uninstall).
- Reducing complexity in Kubernetes deployments.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running. For local Kubernetes with Colima, use:

```bash
colima start --with-kubernetes
